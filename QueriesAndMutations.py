This module contains two classes, Queries and Mutations, that construct and
return various GraphQL queries and mutations.

The Queries class contains static methods that construct and return various
GraphQL queries. Each method corresponds to a specific type of query, such as
checking authentication, creating a page query, creating variables for a query,
and more.

The Mutations class contains static methods that construct and return various
GraphQL mutations. Each method corresponds to a specific type of mutation,
such as following a user or liking an activity.
